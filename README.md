GenAI Projects Made With reference of Course done. 

1.	Building RAG Document Q&A Using Nvidia NIM.
Developed a document-based question–answering system using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The system retrieves relevant content from uploaded documents and generates accurate answers, helping reduce incorrect or generic responses. This project provided practical experience in building reliable LLM-based applications.

2.	YouTube Video and URL Summarization GenAI App.
Built a Generative AI application to summarize content from YouTube videos and web URLs. The application extracts key information and generates concise summaries, making it easier to understand long videos or articles quickly.

3.	SQL Chatbot Using LangChain SQL Toolkit. 
Created an SQL chatbot that allows users to query databases using natural language. The chatbot converts user queries into SQL, executes them on the database, and returns readable results, improving accessibility for non-technical users.
